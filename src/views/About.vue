      Like a lot of people, I'm anxiously waiting for the world to return to
      some normality. With vaccinations starting to roll out accross the world,
      we are one step closer to being able to go out with friends, and travel
      again. While looking for vaccination numbers I saw that a lot of the
      countries were not updating their vaccination counts very regulary and
      wanted a better idea of how many people were vaccinated right now, so I
      decided to work it out and it ended up leading to this. Obviously the live
      numbers aren't real, they are just to give an idea of how many people
      might be vaccinated at this point, and how quickly it is happening.

      While it is exciting watching the numbers go up everyday, we are still a
      while off returning to normal, so remember to stay safe, wash your hands,
      wear and mask and follow guidlines until the time comes when the expert
      say it's no longer needed.
